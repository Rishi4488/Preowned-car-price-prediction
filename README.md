# Preowned-car-price-prediction
## Overview

To be able to predict used cars market value can help both buyers and sellers. There are lots of individuals who are interested in the used car market at some points in their life because they wanted to sell their car or buy a used car. In this process, it’s a big corner to pay too much or sell less then it’s market value.

In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like Present_Price, Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.

## Goal

We are required in this notebook to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
